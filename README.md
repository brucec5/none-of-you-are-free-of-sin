## What?

This is a chrome extension for blocking related videos created by a configurable list of channels.

## Why?

If you watch any video game related content on youtube, your recommendations will invariably turn to trash. You'll either be getting a bunch of clickbaity top 10 lists, uninteresting let's plays by boorish or unfunny people, or hour long rants about how women are terrible. Rather than waiting for Youtube to fix their recommendation algorithm, I figured I would block them myself.

Rather than using a fixed list of channels to block (like the great [Hbomb's YouTube Censorship Addon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbombs-youtube-censorship/djhicpapmcmjabcmkdecglggplpnmkid?hl=en-GB) does), I wanted the list to be user-configurable. This way, I won't have to update the extension when new terrible channels are created.
